# Revealing the Role of SPP1+ Macrophages in Glioma

Here, we deposit the supporting code and data from our glioma cancer research, making it accessible to the wider scientific community.

## Introduction
This study presents a detailed examination of the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) landscape within the glioma tumor microenvironment (TME). We identify vital TAM subpopulation involved in tumor progression and suggest potential targets for developing combined therapies. Additionally, we constructed a novel prognostic model to improve risk assessment for glioma patients. 

## Contents of this repository
This repository has been organized to host the important code utilized in our research. The code, along with the processed data, has been systematically arranged corresponding to the figures. To facilitate easy reading and further scientific investigations, we have also deposited HTML files generated by R Markdown. The following folders can be found within this repository:
